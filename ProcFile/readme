procfs1.c
---------

This module creates a 'helloworld' file in the proc file system. This is done
using proc_create function. For deleting this file the proc_remove function is
used.

The proc file supports read and write operations. Both write and read from the
global variable integer_from_user. To tell the kernel which functions to link
for write and read, a struct file_operations is defined at line 180.

The write is implemented in proc_write and the argument description is
specified in the code comments. Same happens for read which is implemented
using proc_read.

Also the module prints KERN_DEBUG messages which can be consulted using dmesg.
